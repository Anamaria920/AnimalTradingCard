    			<p> Koalas are mostly nocturnal. Nocturnal animals are awake at night and asleep during the day. Koalas, however, sleep for part of the night and also sometimes move about in the daytime. They often sleep for up to 18-20 hours each day. </p>

    					<p> A mature male has a dark scent gland in the centre of his white chest which exudes a dark, sticky substance. He rubs this on his trees to indicate to other Koalas that this is his territory</p>

    					<p> Baby Koalas are known as "Joeys". Scientists often refer to them using terms like "juveniles", "pouch young" and "back young".</p>
